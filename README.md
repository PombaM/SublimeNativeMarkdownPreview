# Preview Markdown with Remarkable

This [Sublime Text 3](http://sublimetext.com/) plugin requires [Remarkable](https://remarkableapp.github.io/) to work.

If you don't know what's Remarkable head over to it's [website](https://remarkableapp.github.io/) and see it for yourself.

#### Remarkable's features:
-  Live Preview
-  Github Markdown
- Export to PDF and HTML
-  Custom CSS
- Syntax Highlighting
- Completely Customizable
- and more.

#### Motivation:
Sublime Text is a fantastic text editor. It's fast, beautiful and pretty much any (missing) functionality can be extended by using third party plugins and having used GitHub's [Atom text editor](https://www.atom.io) exclusively for a year, the only thing I miss the most about Atom is it's markdown handling skills (Live preview) it's awesome and we know SublimeText has no proper support for Markdown.
 The only thing that comes close to Atom in terms of markdown skills is Remarkable which is really ***The best markdown editor for Linux and Windows***.

I wrote this plugin to merge my two favorite tools seamlessly, it provide a quicker way to view/edit markdown files using Remarkable.
