# Preview Markdown with Remarkable

This [Sublime Text 3](http://sublimetext.com/) plugin requires [Remarkable, The best markdown editor for Linux and Windows](https://remarkableapp.github.io/) as SublimeText has no proper support for Markdown.

#### Motivation:
Sublime Text is a fantastic text editor. It's fast, beautiful and pretty much any (missing) functionality can be extended using third party plugins and having used GitHub's [Atom text editor](https://www.atom.io) exclusively for a year, the only thing I miss the most about Atom is it's markdown handling skils (Live preview) it's awesome and only thing anything came close to Atom in terms of markdown skills is Remarkable which is really ***The best markdown editor for Linux and Windows***.

I wrote this plugin to merge my two favourite tools seamlessly, it provide a quicker way to view/edit markdown files using Remarkable.
